        Reasons to refinance a mortgage
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Refinancing can help you meet your financial goals. Explore the most
        common reasons you might consider refinancing your mortgage.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Lower interest rate</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Reducing the interest rate is by far the most popular reason to
        refinance a mortgage. If you can qualify for a lower rate than your
        existing mortgage interest rate, refinancing can reduce your monthly
        mortgage payments or potentially save thousands in interest over the
        life of your loan.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">
        Switch rate type: adjustable vs fixed
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        When you refinance, you can select a different loan type. For example,
        if you have an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) and the rate is about to
        increase, you can change to a more stable fixed-rate mortgage.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Cancel mortgage insurance</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        When you purchase a home with less than 20% of the home price as your
        down payment, you'll likely pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) or a
        mortgage insurance premium (MIP), common with conventional and FHA
        loans, respectively. If you've gained equity of at least 20%, whether by
        appreciation or by simply paying your mortgage, you may be able to
        refinance to cancel mortgage insurance and save money with each monthly
        payment.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Pay off the loan faster</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        In most cases, shortening your loan term allows you to pay off your
        principal faster. A shorter term often means you'll have a higher
        monthly payment but fewer overall payments, reducing interest over the
        life of your loan. Additionally, shorter-term loans (i.e. 15-year fixed)
        typically have lower interest rates than those with longer terms (i.e.
        30-year fixed).
        <br />
        <br />
        You can also speed up your loan repayment to a bi-weekly cadence, which
        many lenders allow. Bi-weekly payments equate to one extra payment each
        year and 51 fewer months on a 30-year loan. This ultimately reduces the
        amount of interest you pay. Before signing, confirm a bi-weekly payment
        option with your lender.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Reduce monthly payments</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Refinancing typically resets the length of your mortgage to 15 or 30
        years. Your current principal balance stretches across the additional
        payments, reducing your monthly cost. If you have a lump sum to apply to
        your existing mortgage amount, try a cash-in refinance which reduces
        monthly payments further. The cash decreases the balance which is then
        spread across additional payments.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Withdraw cash</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        If you have enough equity in your home, you may be able to do a cash-out
        refinance. With cash-out refinancing, you refinance your current home
        loan for more than the amount you currently owe and keep the extra money
        to spend on things like home projects or paying off other high-interest
        debt. Cash-out refinances typically have higher interest rates. In the
        "advanced settings" on the refinance calculator you can convert the tool
        to a cash-out refinance calculator.
