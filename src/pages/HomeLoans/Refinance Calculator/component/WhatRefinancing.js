      <p className="mb-6">
        Refinancing a mortgage is the process of replacing your existing loan by
        acquiring a new home loan in its place that suits your financial
        circumstances. The funds from your new mortgage pay off your existing
        mortgage. Just like acquiring your purchase mortgage, you’ll need to
        gather your supporting documentation such as your recent pay stubs,
        W-2s, and bank statements. But you’ll also need details about your
        existing mortgage, including the remaining loan amount, the number of
        years left to pay and the interest rate. This information helps you and
        your lender calculate the best refinance loan option for your financial
        situation.
