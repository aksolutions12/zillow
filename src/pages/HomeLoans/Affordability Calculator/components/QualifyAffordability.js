        Lenders have a pre-qualification process that takes your finances (such
        as income and debt) into account to determine how much they are willing
        to lend you. Once the lender has completed a preliminary review, they
        generally provide a pre-qualification letter that states how much
        mortgage you qualify for. Get pre-qualified by a lender to confirm your
        affordability.
